        <p style="text-transform: none">He has dark brown hair, tan skin, and green eyes. He also goes to Saotome Academy. He was a black cat with green eyes when he was cursed. He also has a purple tattoo on his upper right chest.

Cecil also wears a blue necklace at all times; it contains muses who assist him in writing beautiful poetry. This necklace was used to connect people with the gods.

    <h1><span class="headline">Personality</span></h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2em; text-transform: none;">
    Cecil was cheeky during the first parts of the Master Course and wanted nothing to do with becoming an idol, often stating that he only cared about being with Haruka Nanami. Once he realized he wanted to become an idol due to members of ST☆RISH inspiring him, he changed his mind and asked to join ST☆RISH.<br><br>

Cecil often gives advice to the other members of ST☆RISH. He is very insightful and sensitive to the feelings of others, likely because of the spiritual and cultural influences of his country. Despite mystical first impressions, Cecil actually carries himself with a child-like spirit and curiosity.<br><br>

At times he is unintentionally rude or too forward because of his inability to sense what is appropriate in the culture that he is in. He is enthusiastic about nearly everything in Japan. Perhaps because of his royal upbringing, he is used to getting what he wants and is often confused when he can't instantly have it. This is shown at one point in Amazing Aria, where he requests to purchase a shopping mall. Later in the series, he learns and matures, often demonstrating modesty and respect.<br><br>

    <p style="line-height: 2em; text-transform: none;">
        ●  His official age is listed as "Unknown" (年齢不詳) for the game Debut as well as the anime, though he appears similar in age to the ST☆RISH boys (notably, at the least around the age of Syo, the youngest, and Otoya), while along with them also addressing the older boys as "senpai" (similar to an upperclassman role in Japan).
        ●  Just like all the members of ST☆RISH, he has a designated theme color. For Cecil, it is green.<br><br>
        ●  Cecil is the only foreign member of ST☆RISH.<br><br>
        ●  According to Ai's data, Cecil dislikes and is scared of water and fish, most likely due to living in the desert.<br><br>
        ●  Cecil has a pet panther named Luu Luu.<br><br>
        ●  During Original or Repeat game, he only appears once in each of the six guys' routes, giving the heroine pieces of advice. The only exception is in his route where he finally makes a permanent appearance.<br><br>
        ●  Otoya and Cecil are maternal half-brothers.<br><br>
        ●  Given Otoya's estimated age at the time of Kotomi's disappearance and Cecil's birthdate, Cecil may be at least approximately eighteen-and-a-half months younger than Otoya, which would make him the youngest member of ST☆RISH. However, his official age remains unconfirmed.<br><br>
        ●  The official website for the anime confirmed Syo's and Otoya's ages to both be 15, along with Haruka's being the same age as them. However, since Otoya's birthday is in April (April 11th), not long after a Japanese school year begins (April 1st), should the series' school system be based on Japan's, he'd age right after the beginning of the school year to 16. In comparison, Syo's birthday (the date of which he also shares with Natsuki - June 9th) follows Otoya's; meaning Syo would age after him, but not long after as well. This would also apply to Cecil, whose birthday is October 31st (following Syo's, who'd age before him) also coming after April; and possibly Haruka, noted to be the same age as Otoya and Syo (though she is not given an official birthdate). (If Haruka were the same age as both of them, based on a real world system, this would place her birthday after April 1st, and possibly before Syo's June 9th.)<br><br>
